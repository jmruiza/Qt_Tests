# Qt_Tests

Qt tests project using dlls to encapsulate the classes and form classes. 

I'm looking for:

-> Make easier updates of "modules".
-> The Form Classes (QDialog) they would be called from the menu bar of a "main window".

This project will be used as a test for another project than will be used only in Windows.
